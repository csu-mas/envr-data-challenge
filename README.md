## Background  
This data challenge considers a rich collection of historical and future climate information from
three different sources: 1) a global climate model, 2) a reanalysis data product, and 3) a
dynamically downscaled product. Each of these different sources include daily values of
maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation on different spatial scales over
a swath of North America covering the continental United States of America (CONUS), much of
southern Canada and northern Mexico. The future climate for both the global climate model and
the downscaled product are based on RCP8.5, one of the four Representative Concentration
Pathways (RCPs) describing 21st century greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric
concentrations, air pollutant emissions, and land use which are a part of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report (https://www.ipcc.ch/). RCP8.5 is
considered a pathway with very high greenhouse gas emissions and is often referred to as
“business as usual”.

#### Contest Rules
1. Teams of up to 4 students (anyone actively enrolled in K-12, undergraduate, or graduate
school who has not yet obtained a PhD; note, a team can have a mixture across different
experience levels), and one additional non-student senior collaborator if desired (not
mandatory). The team will be placed in the category of the most senior student participant
(e.g., if the team is made up of 3 Masters students and 1 PhD student, its submission will be
judged in the PhD category, etc.).
2. Teams that participated in the 2020 Challenge ARE allowed to participate in the 2021
Challenge but must work on a completely different application.
3. Submissions must be received by July 1, 2021 at 6pm EDT for full consideration.
4. Submission Requirements: A report (pdf format) including:
    1. A cover page including the title and listing the educational institution, level, and contact
    information for each participant, as well as the contact information and title of a senior
    collaborator if warranted.
    2. An executive summary (no more than one page); in addition to the one-page executive
    summary, teams can submit an optional video (duration < 5 min) that describes their
    project (see Submission instructions).
    3. A written report no longer than 10 pages following a scientific paper format (please use
    the sample PLoS One Word or LaTeX templates located in the data folder)
    4. Code that can be used to replicate the results and graphics presented in the report
    (see Submission instructions).
